## PROJECT

### MEDICAL STORE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

It is a management system of Medical Store, to maintain and manage record of medicines, employees and transactions related information.
It is a one stop intelligent solution of problems every medical store owners faces.
Moreover, its friendly GUI makes it more useful and time saving.
Administrator can manage everything, and each employee will have there own account, thus, making each employee work private from each other. However, ADMIN can observe everything.

Employees will only have rights for adding records, and there attendance is monitored within the application. Employees can reset the password either by their unique User Name or by directly contacting the administrator of the store.

Administrator credentials are given below, they can not be reset by the admin itself, if in case lost or forgotten. Admin needs to contact the engineer for the recovery.
User Name: admin
Password: root
For this project, Java language and MySQL databases are used.

```


## 2. BACKEND WORKING

```markdown
NetBeans IDE is used for designing GUI and Java coding. As MySQL queries are initiated in Java instructions,
MySQL connector J is used which export the extracted SQL query from Java to MySQL database.
For this purpose, MySQL JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) driver is added in libraries of Java project. 
The folder containing .jar file of the connector.
The rs2xml.jar file which is added to the libraries of Java project, makes it possible to view any 
changes in table in GUI.
